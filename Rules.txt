Thank you for playing Rohan's Last Stand! Before you begin, here are the rules of the game:

1. Each player starts with 20 health.
2. Each player has a deck of cards, which are drawn from at the start of the game and during the game.
3. Each player has a hand of cards, which are played onto the board.
5. Most cards have 3 attributes - health, attack, and defense.

Attack and defense are used to calculate damage during an Assault, while health is used to determine if a card is destroyed.
Some cards have another attribute - special abilities. These are used to determine how the card interacts with other cards.
Examples include buffing, debuffing, and armor shredding.

4. Each player can play a card from their hand onto the board in an empty position.
5. The players alternate turns before an Assault, playing as many cards as they want before passing their turn, allowing the other to play.
6. After each player has played their cards, an Assault takes place
7. During an Assault, each card on the board attacks the opposing cards in the corresponding position.
8. If a card's health reaches 0, it is removed from the board.
9. If a card is not present in the corresponding position, the opposing card attacks the player's health directly.
10. The game ends when one player's health reaches 0.

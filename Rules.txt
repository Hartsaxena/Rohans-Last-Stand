﻿Thank you for playing Rohan's Last Stand!  
Before you begin, please read the rules carefully.

---

## 1. Game Setup

- Starting Health: Each player begins with 20 Health.
- Deck: Each player shuffles their owned deck, then draws 7 cards to form their starting hand.

## 2. Turn Structure

1. Card Deployment Phase  
   - Players alternate playing cards from hand onto empty board slots.  
   - On Attack, you may play any card unless it has the DEFENSE_ONLY condition.  
   - On Defense, you may only play on slots with an opponent’s card, and only if the card does not have the ATTACK_ONLY condition or is blocked by SURPRISE.
2. End of Plays  
   - When both players pass (or click “Finish”), the game enters the Assault Phase.
3. Draw Phase  
   - After Assault, shuffle each deck and draw until you have 7 cards.
4. First Attacker Alternation  
   - The player who did not attack first last round attacks first this round.

## 3. Card Attributes

- Health (HP): When reduced to 0 or less, the card is discarded.  
- Attack (ATK): Damage dealt when attacking.  
- Defense (DEF): Reduces incoming damage.  
- Play Condition:  
  - FREE: Play anytime.  
  - ATTACK_ONLY: Only on attack.  
  - DEFENSE_ONLY: Only on defense.

## 4. Combat (Assault Phase)

- Pairwise Battles: Each card attacks the opposing slot:
  - With Opponent’s Card: Damage = _Attacker ATK_ − _Defender DEF_ (min 0), then subtract from the card's HP.  
    If this damage exceeds the card’s remaining HP, the **overflow** (excess) is dealt to the opposing player’s Health.
  - Empty Slot: Damage goes directly to the opposing player’s Health.
- Fatigue of War: If both deal 0 damage in a battle, both lose 1 HP instead.

## 5. Discarding & Shuffling

- When a card’s HP ≤ 0 during Assault:  
  1. Remove it from the board.  
  2. Place it on the bottom of its owner’s deck.  
- Shuffle decks at the start of the game and after every Assault.

## 6. Special Abilities

- Play-Applied: Trigger upon playing (e.g., "Inspire" buffs allied cards immediately).  
- Assault-Applied: Trigger during Assault (e.g., "Armor Pierce" ignores defense before damage).  
- See the official Card List for details on each ability.

## 7. Winning the Game

- The first player to reduce their opponent’s Health to 0 wins the game.

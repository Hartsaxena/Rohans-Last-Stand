Thanks for checking out Rohan's Last Stand - a card game based on the Battle of Helm's Deep from The Lord of the Rings trilogy.

I made this small game for my English class project.

The game is written in C++ and uses the SDL2 graphics library (version 2.30.0 specifically).


## How to Play

1. Download the latest release
2. Unzip the downloaded file
3. Run the `Rohans-Last-Stand.exe` file
4. Enjoy!


Note: It is recommended to read the rules of the game before playing. You can find them in the `Rules.txt` file included in the download.
